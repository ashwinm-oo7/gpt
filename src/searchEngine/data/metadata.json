  "summary": "Design-time metadata, tables, views, and rendering flow for a fully dynamic ERP report engine. Explains how reports are created using structured tables (sabtopleft_report_up, sabrep_topleft, sabrep_topleft_Box), dynamic view naming, mandatory fields, positioning, layout rules, and runtime execution flow inside the ERP system.",
  "purpose": "Build dynamic reports from database metadata without hard-coded layouts. Report design is stored in tables; the engine reads definitions at runtime and binds them to data using predefined SQL views.",
  "document_structure": [
    "Overview",
    "Report master table",
    "Field layout table",
    "Section container table",
    "Section definitions",
    "View requirements",
    "Runtime execution logic",
    "Special keywords",
    "Connectivity rules"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Report definitions are completely dynamic.",
    "Rendering engine binds design → data using sabid and colname.",
    "Views must follow strict naming pattern based on regcode.",
    "All layout positions are stored in millimeters.",
    "Lines and headings use reserved keywords (line, vline, !heading)."
