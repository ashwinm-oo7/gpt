# Report Designing (ERP)

**Purpose:** Build dynamic reports from database metadata (no hard-coded layouts). All report designs are stored in tables & views; the engine reads those definitions and renders the report at runtime.

_Source: original doc._ :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Overview

The system uses three primary tables to store report definitions and layout:

1. `sabtopleft_report_up` — report master (header / regcode based report) each report have one record/per sabid.  
2. `sabrep_topleft` — fields/controls metadata (position, font, alignment,style)  
3. `sabrep_topleft_Box` — section containers (section name, size, location)

These tables are related using `sabid` as the primary link. Views named `sabrep_<section>_<regcode>` provide data for each section.

---

## Table: sabtopleft_report_up (Report Master)

**Purpose:** store high-level report info and metadata.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[sabtopleft_report_up](
   NULL,

## Section Keywords & Semantics

  * report: main container / page settings (report section is mainly used for declared page size and width
		   which will be the main container for the report 
                 every component will be under in this report section.)

*  companyheader_image: logo position (ttop=0,tleft=0,width=80,height=80)

* companyheader: company name and address (width=0 → stretch full page) (this section used for view the image in the 
                companyheader section on top left side corner and the location
                mentioned  ttop=0,tleft=0,width=80,height=80
                so in the left top corner will be seen the output.)

* pageheader: document header (EntNo, EntDt, etc.)

* details: transaction line items

* reportfooter: totals / summary (renders once at the end)

* pagefooter: page-level footer (appears on each page)
   *   This section appears at the bottom of every page in a report — specifically,on the last line (footer area) of each page.
   * It is used to display information that should repeat on all pages, such as:
     * 	Page numbers (e.g., Page 1 of 10)
     * Date and time of printing
     * Report title or company name
     * Confidentiality note or signature line

**Note Important: sabrep_topleft.colname values must match the column names returned by the corresponding
  sabrep_?section)_?regcode) view. This is how the engine binds design → data.** 
## Views: naming and mandatory columns
* Each section must have a view with the naming pattern:
* sabrep_?section)_?regcode) : e.g. sabrep_companyheader_chlf.
* Mandatory columns per view:
  * sabrep_companyheader_*: colname, bname, comp
  * sabrep_pageheader_*: sabid, colname, bname
  * sabrep_details_*: sabid, plus line item columns (e.g., sno, party, permit)
  * sabrep_reportfooter_*: tag, subreptable (subreptable identifies a view to execute, can be text or grid)
  * sabrep_pagefooter_*: tag, subreptable, tabletag**
  * View example (company header):
``` sql  
  CREATE VIEW sabrep_companyheader_?regcode) AS
SELECT 'compname' colname, 'Transport Pass' bname, pid a.comp
FROM sabcompany a 
UNION ALL
SELECT 'compadr', 'Collector Palghar (Supply Dept)' bname, a.pid
FROM sabcompany a
UNION ALL
SELECT 'line1','line',a.pid FROM sabcompany a 
UNION ALL
SELECT 'heading','!heading' bname,a.pid FROM sabcompany a

``` 
**Mandatory columns in these views:  colname, bname, comp (where applicable).** 

***Special keywords (colname / bname)***
* Heading — printed as section heading
* line — draw horizontal line
* vline — draw vertical line
These reserved keywords produce graphics/layout behavior rather than textual data.

             
**Note:Always must match when insert/update in sabrep_topleft table in that column colname value must match with the view sabrep_????????? In that column colname then
only design setup.
Sabrep_topleft.colname=viewname.colname**

3) **details**: This section Defines in the Page mid container declared
   * This view represents the DETAILS SECTION of your report.
In ERP reporting, the Details section is where all line-items or transaction rows appear.
   * This view supplies the exact data the report engine will repeat for every row in the “details” grid.
   *  Why this View Exists? (Core Purpose)
       ##
	    ```
		*  sabrep_details_chlf is a data provider for the DETAILS section of the report with regcode = chlf
        *  Your report engine follows a strict rule:
        *  For every section in a report, a view must exist whose name is: sabrep_?section)_?regcode)
        *  So for:
        * Section: details
		* Regcode: chlf
		* The engine automatically expects this view:		=> sabrep_details_chlf
		➤ This view provides ALL the transaction rows that the “Details” part of the report should print.
``` sql 
CREATE VIEW sabrep_details_chlf AS
SELECT  
    a.sabid,
    a.sno,
    asab9_a.person AS party,
    asab9_a.pdukanno,
    a.permit
FROM bsab_trkchl_mid a 
LEFT JOIN asab9 AS asab9_a ON a.party = asab9_a.pid;
   ```
### Mendatory column in this view is:colname ,bname,sabid
  * a) colname:used for understand what kind of data for a developer understand also usedcase for connectivity design alignment location in the table sabrep_topleft.
Note:Later will explain
  * b) bname: this bname value will be seen as a output in the Report.
 * c) sabid:connectivity in report which record want to show at a time
    * (sabid is the master key that tells your report engine which specific record is being printed.).
  * Your engine always passes something like:
  ```sql
  WHERE sabid = ?sabid)
  ```
***Note : ?columnname) it means current form any column values passed from that current open form.
So only the rows belonging to this specific report entry print.***

**sabrep_topleft table=>column wise explaination below:**
* repcode: repcode of the report
* section: pageheader section for the top page show the party or coustomer details.
* ttop   : top left corner start
* tleft  : page left side start
* height : height of the container report 
* width  : width of the container report
* line_left: Container border line show in the left side
* line_right: Container border line show in the right side
* line_bottom: Container border line show in the bottom side
* line_up : Container border line show in the up side
* line_height: Container border height show in the top and bottom side and width for left and right side all four side line effect there size.
* caption: caption show for value label
* colname: colname exact same in the mentioned of view sabrep_pageheader_?regcode). its dynamic regcode which report is mentioned.  
```sql When Does the View Execute? (Runtime Flow)
When user clicks PRINT REPORT:

1) Report engine loads sabtopleft_report_up → gets sabid

2) Engine loads section metadata from:

  * sabrep_topleft

  * sabrep_topleft_Box

3) Then it finds this view:

  * sabrep_details_chlf

4) Engine executes:

➤ SELECT * FROM sabrep_details_chlf WHERE sabid = ?sabid)

5) For each row returned → engine prints one detail row
   ➤ If 10 rows returned → 10 lines print in the Details Section
   ➤ If 0 rows returned → Details section prints empty

6) Why Only These Columns?

Because these are the columns your report design refers to.

In sabrep_topleft, you will have rows like:
| section | colname  | caption  |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| details | sno      | Sr.No    |
| details | party    | Party    |
| details | pdukanno | Dukan No |
| details | permit   | Permit   |

Meaning:

Whatever colname is used in design must exist in this view

If design has a column missing from this view → report shows blank
```
