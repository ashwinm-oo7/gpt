## üìò Overview
The **Food Corporation of India (FCI)** has played a vital role in transforming India‚Äôs food security ‚Äî shifting from a crisis-management approach to a stable and efficient system.

To enhance its operational efficiency, FCI now requires a comprehensive **ERP system** to:

- Manage government orders for commodities like:
  - Ration
  - Rice (*Chawal*)
  - Wheat (*Gheu*)
- Monitor and control distribution to various ration shops
- Track inventory levels and movement in real-time
- Ensure compliance and transparency in supply chain operations

---

### ‚ú® Key Goals:
- Digitally manage and track **commodity allocations** (e.g., ration, rice, wheat)
- Automate **distribution planning** to regional shops
- Implement area-based **logistics planning** using vehicle type logic
- Maintain **master records** across cities, parties, transports, and products
- Enable **real-time visibility** into vehicle, inventory, and shop allocations

---

## üöõ Logistics & Transportation Management

Transportation is a key component of FCI‚Äôs supply process. The ERP will handle vehicle assignment, load balancing, and delivery planning based on destination constraints.

The ERP will also manage transportation logistics. FCI uses two types of trucks for supply:

### ‚úÖ Truck Types and Use Cases

- **8-Wheeler Trucks**
  - Assigned to destinations with **limited roadside space or narrow streets**
  - Ideal for small shop locations with parking constraints

- **12-Wheeler Trucks**
  - Sent to areas with **wider roads and sufficient space for parking**
  - Used for larger deliveries to major distribution centers or towns

> üß† **Note**: Truck allocation is pre-linked with each party based on their location‚Äôs road access. This prevents routing issues and delays.


üöö *Truck allocation is pre-determined based on party address infrastructure and area suitability.*

---
## üó∫Ô∏è Area Master Configuration

To manage location-based routing and logistics, the system includes a comprehensive **AreaMaster** menu with the following forms:

- **Country Master**
- **State Master**
- **District Master**
- **City Master**

These masters help segment and validate delivery routes, ensure accurate address mapping, and support reporting at regional levels.
